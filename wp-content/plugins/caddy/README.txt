== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the Caddy cart icon & link to my menu or header? =

Search for the "Caddy Cart" widget and add it to your header. 

Or, you can use our included shortcodes using the [Shortcodes in Menus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/) plugin and then adding the following Caddy shortcodes:
\[cc_saved_items text='Saves' icon='yes'\]
\[cc_cart_items text='Cart' icon='yes'\]

The "text" value is the text that you want to appear in your menu.
The "icon" value (yes or no) will display a heart icon for the "Saves" link and a cart icon for the "Cart" link

= Does Caddy work with multisite? =

Yes.

= Can I translate Caddy? =

Absolutely! You can find instructions [here](https://support.usecaddy.com/knowledge-base/how-to-translate-caddy-into-different-languages/).

No. We‚Äôve built Caddy with performance in mind and have fine tuned it for speed.
